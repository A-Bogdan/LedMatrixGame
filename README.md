# Homework 5
### Components
16X2 LCD Display, 8X8 Led Matrix, Joystick, Button, Buzzer;
### Implementation
This homework's task is to create a mini game using the mentioned components while also adding an intuitive menu for the user. I decided to implemement the forever classic "Snake", the game in which you control the snake and guite towards points of food on the map. Eating the food will increase the length of the snake and the player's score. If the player guides the snake towards itself, it's game over.
### Menu Items:
#### 0. Greeting State(for a few seconds after booting up the game, the LED matrix will greet you with the snake's face and the LCD with the game's title);
#### 1. Start game(the game is launched, the player can now control the snake and see his/her score on the LCD Display);
#### 2. Highscores(TBI, a list of the top players and their respective scores);
#### 3. Settings(TBI, change level difficulty, matrix brightness, LCD contrast, change player name);
#### 4. How to play(quick introduction to the controls and the game's objective);
#### 5. About (info about the creator's name);
#### ! All items except "Start game" will display a unique drawing on the LED matrix;
